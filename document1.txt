Bob has a house together with Alice on the garden, the weather is very sunny.
And nothing more was said about that, Other than that - Bob and Alice was inside the house all the time. they wasn't actually outside. So they were in the house. Or was they outside, I don't know..
This story is boring. And a bit confusing isn't it?

Another story,
where Bob is out on the ocean, and looking up in the sky
