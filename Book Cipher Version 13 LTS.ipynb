    "#### Key Words:   BookCipher ,  Obfuscation , Steganography , Cryptography, \n",
    "------------------------------------\n",
    "#### Project Purpose:\n",
    "\"Why did I make this project?\"\n",
    "I have asked myself that question.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This has been on my mind forever. Yes, **forever**. \n",
    "As long as I can remember it, the first time I heard about encryption, or anything related to it at all; was book-ciphers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was quite cool thing actually, so I obviously, **searched on the internet** (This was a few years ago, 6 or even 8 to 10 years ago, approx.) **For a program that would do that**; \n",
    "\n",
    "You would provide a message, a book - and it would find the words you typed in, *in the book*. \n",
    "\n",
    "And, it would give the so-called 'Book-Code' This is a sequence of \"sub-keys\" that are needed for decrypting. This sequence of \"sub-keys\"'s purpose, would be - If entered correctly into the program; It(the program) would find only those words which corresponds to the sub-keys. And, print those out.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, of course there already was these, so-called 'Book-Code Encryptors and Decryptors' online,\n",
    "**but I wanted a program**, (That, for 1 reason of many, many reasons; could run offline, and where I could learn from it, improve it,(...) and so on.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly, I never found any **completely-done, fully-working,  program that does that.** On the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not even today. \n",
    "\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now - that is. although, I \"Didn't found\", but I \"Made\" one.\n",
    "In python!, trough Jupyter!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, here is a book cipher, implemented in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hope it can help those who, from years ago - who searched for a book cipher, like I did(like crazy). And, I (**again**) hope this can help those who,  In the **Future**; Searches for a BookCipher.\n",
    "One example of this, would be a question on stack overflow\n",
    "* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42926663/arnold-book-cipher-with-python\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "This question, I have since **YEARS AGO** (Ever since I started having this idea to make this program) I have looked at ever since then. And I am happy to be able to answer it, although - I am quite surprised *No-one still have a answer(a **A working, answer that is**)* To it.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "This question, is nearly (**If not identical**) to my problem I faced  **Years ago.** The idea was simple, and could be theoretically answered - like any other \"plan\" or \"architecture/structure\" of how a program would work..\n",
    " \n",
    " \"In theory, it's very simple.\"\n",
    " \n",
    " **In practice ...**\n",
    " **It isn't easy.**\n",
    " \"In practice, it can get **very, very difficult.**\"\n",
    " \n",
    " I am myself very pleased with this program. Feel free to use it, I made it mainly - for myself, although I want to share this. So I really hope this can be useful for anyone who - like me, has for decades ago searched like crazy on the net for a book cipher, in for example python.\n",
