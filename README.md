| Recommending this link. Provided a full very good and detailed question. https://stackoverflow.com/q/42926663/14346786
It is the question I have originally been following for more than 2 years+.  Wished someone would just 'come along with a solution'.. But that never happened.
In this case, It was myself who came up with a (hopefully, acceptably Okay) Solution. Or answer.
If you like this, or if this is/will/was helpful - In any **possible way** PLEASE tell me that! Either via mail, or just about anything.

*Of course, if you would like to improve this, please please **please** do so. It is extremely appreciated.*


Thank you!
